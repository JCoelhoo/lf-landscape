# **NOTE: If your company logo needs changed, please submit an [LF Support Request](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/23/create/563) rather than changing here**

### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you including a `repo_url`? You need to pick the single best GitHub repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Is your project open source?
* [ ] Is this project hosted by the Linux Foundation?
* [ ] Have you picked the single best (existing) category for your project?
* [ ] Does it follow the other guidelines from the [new entries](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-landscape#new-entries) section?
* [ ] Have you included a URL for your SVG or added it to `hosted_logos` and referenced it there?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly state the name of the project/product and follow the other logo [guidelines](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-landscape#logos)?
* [ ] Does your project name match the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you verified that the Crunchbase data for your organization is correct (including headquarters and LinkedIn)?
* [ ] ~5 minutes after opening the pull request, the CNCF-Bot will post the URL for your staging server. Have you confirmed that it looks good to you and then added a comment to the PR saying "LGTM"?
